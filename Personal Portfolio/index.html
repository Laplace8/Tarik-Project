            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hey. I'm  Tarik, a passionate CE student interested in Data Science 
               and Database engineering systems. This is a small project I made for my 
               Internet Technologies class. <3 </p>
            <p>Over the years, I have worked on numerous projects that surely helped me 
               to improove as a student and as an adult. I learned a lot. I learned what 
               kind of field I wanted to work in and in full honesty WebDev isn't my strongsuit.
               I want to persue Academical achivements. Write teases, reserch papers and essentially 
               learn stuff that can help people out. Spending 40 hours writing and debuging code may
               be interesing for some people but I personally am not one of them. So with the good and 
               the bad this is my website, Hope you like it MR.Tarique.</p>

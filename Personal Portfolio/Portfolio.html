            <h2>Java</h2>
            <p>Role: Student</p>
            <p>Tools: Eclips, Netbeens IDE's</p>
            <p>- I passed 3 semesters work of Java classes raging from Introduction to java, to GUI design and Application Engineering.
                Overall it was a fun experience for my first programing language to be Java. Still miss the "Hello World" stages.

        <div class="project">
            <h2>SQL</h2>
            <p>Role: Student </p>
            <p>Tools: W3schools, MySQL</p>
            <p>- SQL was the first programing language that I learned by myself. I was taking Algorithms class and just got qurious. 
                 I enjoy and still work on emprooving on it. I Feel as if it is the programing language for me.

        <div class="project">
            <h2>C++</h2>
            <p>Role: Student (Currently)</p>
            <p>Tools: Visual Studio .net Framework</p>
            <p>- I failed OOP back in Thailand and had to take it again this semester. It surely made me remember why I failed it in the first
                 place. I have a lot of studying to do before I can say that I know C++.
